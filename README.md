This is a very bare bones project demostrating some of the CCPhysics basics. The game consists of only three classes. AppDelegate shows how to setup Cocos2D with some of the basic options. ColorMatchScene is the main scene class that contains the game logic and physics setup code. The last class, Ball, shows how to make a CCNode with physics properties and also how to accept custom touch input.
